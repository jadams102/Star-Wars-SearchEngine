# Star Wars Search Engine

Star Wars Useless Fact Search Engine

#### By **Joel Adams & Chris Swanner**

## Description

Built using a simple HTML page and nested API calls. The app allows a user to search for just about anything from the Star Wars movie universe (Up to episode VII) using SWAPI (Star Wars API). The user may enter a search term in the given input, select what type of person place or thing they are looking for (character, starship, planet, or species). The program will then make an API call based on the search term, and return up to 50 results. The program also will return a random GIF from Giphy using their API, based on the search term. This project was primarily created to practice making and parsing API call data.
